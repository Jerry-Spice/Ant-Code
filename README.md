# Ant-Code
# This is the repository that houses all the Ant-Code developed to make ants wander and find food.
# **Goal**
1. Create Ants that wander around with a direction vector broken up into components for movement
2. Create food that the ants will try to move towards
3. Create anti-food that the ants will try to avoid
4. create ant spawners and inventories for the ants to contain items
5. simluate large scale ant movements/colonies

This is being modeled after this video by Sebastion Lague: (except I'm trying not to copy it directly and instead learn more about Vector mechanics in code and creating wandering agents).
